Task:
To create a morse code translator using OOP.
The classes used should store all the information needed to translate between Morse code and English (and back again) including alphabets, the word to translate and the eventual output.

Breaking down the problem --> Essential functionality needed:
• Data structure to store morse code characters in JS 
• 


● Build a Class of Translator – this will be extended multiple times for lots of different types of translators.
● Build 2 further Classes (Morse & French/Spanish/German etc) that extend from the translator class and inherit any properties/methods you think it should have.
● Build these translators out to be fully functioning.
● The definition of done is when I (the user) can visit you hosted site, input something in English and receive back the equivalent in, for example, Morse Code.
