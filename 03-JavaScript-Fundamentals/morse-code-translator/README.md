Task:
To create a morse code translator using OOP.
The classes used should store all the information needed to translate between Morse code and English (and back again) including alphabets, the word to translate and the eventual output.

Breaking down the problem -->
- The user needs to be able to input a value
- This input needs to be broken down to be able to 
- On clicking the translate button 
- Researched Morse Code alphabet, 
- Data structure to store morse code characters in JS 
- 
- Additionally if user adds Morse code, translator should be able to translate this back to English equivalent



- Stored the alphabets in objects, with key value pairs
- Created a class of Translator, binding the alphabets to the class
- Created methods for each step of the translation
- Firstly getting the word to translate
- Breaking down the word, turning it into an array to enable it to be looped over.
- Translate input method, uses map() to iterate over the translation array and returning the values from the alphabet object.
- 
- Display the translation in the output box

Extend from the translator class and inherit any properties/methods you think it should have.

Next Steps 
â€¢ Extend the classes to be able to translate other languages.




// TRANSLATION
// 1. GET WORD
// 2. BREAK DOWN WORD TO BE ABLE TO TRANSLATE
// 3. TRANSLATE INPUT
// 4. DISPLAY TRANSLATION IN THE OUTPUT BOX




use keyword 'extends' which gives us access to properties/methods that the Vehicle class holds, so we don't have to repeat them



UI - I created a textured gradient in Illustrator which I've then applied to the background of the webpage and added a horizontal ticker
