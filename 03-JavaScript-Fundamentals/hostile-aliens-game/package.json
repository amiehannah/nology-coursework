  "description": "To create a simple text only game loosely based on Space Invaders.  The game should contain a single button that hits a random alien ship in the fleet.  Each time the button is pressed, a random alien ship is hit and its hit points are reduced.  Once an alien ships points have hit zero the ship is destroyed and canâ€™t be hit again.  The game is over once all alien ships have been destroyed. For best results, approach this challenge with an OOP mindset although some functions may be needed.",
