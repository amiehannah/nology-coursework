/* 
TEXT ONLY BASED GAME 
// SINGLE BUTTON
HITS RANDOM ALIEN SHIP
EACH TIME BUTTON IS PRESSED, RANDOM ALIEN SHIP IS HIT AND POINTS ARE REDUCED
ONE THE ALIEN SHIPS POINT HAVE HIT ZERO THE SHIP IS DESTROYED AND CAN'T BE HIT AGAIN
GAME OVER WHEN ALL ALIEN SHIPS HAVE BEEN HIT

GAME OVER - GAME RESTARTS
TEXT VISUALISATION OF THE SHIPS AND THEIR HIT POINTS
GAME SHOULD CONTAIN: 
1X MOTHERSHIP (100 Hit Points - Loses 9 hit points every time it is hit - All ships are destroyed if the Mother ship is destroyed )
5X DEFENCE SHIPS (Each one starts with 80 hit points - Each one Loses 10 hit points each time it is hit)
8X ATTACKSHIP ( Each starts with 45 hit points - Each loses 12 hit points each time it is hit. )

The main task is to create a game - HOW YOU BREAK DOWN A PROBLEM
TDD and Unit Testing, OOP concepts, and Pure Functions
